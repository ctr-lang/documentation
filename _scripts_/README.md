# _scripts_ Info

__yaml-then-fixture__: Does as described, this scripts will glob all the `.code.md` files in `/docs` (the docs) and generate a `yaml` code block from the `styl` code block. This way we(I) don't have to waste time generating the `yaml` code blocks by hand. After the `yaml` code blocks are generated the script generates the the `[name].fixture.md` file. Funny story, I spent at a minimum of 40 hours doing this by hand before I realized my stupidity and created this script.
