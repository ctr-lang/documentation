# Hosting

I love companies who love Open Source, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) is one of those companies. They offer Open Source projects free use of their pro tier which is all too savory and is how this documentation is being served to you at lighting speed. I give Netlify my personal recommendation for a multitude of reasons but chiefly due to the ease of use and seamless integration. If you want top-of-the-line static hosting, Netlify is at a very minimum worth a look.
