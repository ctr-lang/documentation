# Thanks

As I stand here on the shoulders of giants, I give my deepest thanks and appreciation. None of this would have been possible without the work and effort of countless individuals. No community compares to the Open Source community in my eyes. It's a community I've fallen head over heels for. There's just so much good meaning activity and potential. Four years ago, I barely had a grasp on what Open Source entailed and, truthfully, I was quite dismissive. Nonetheless, today I could not dream of a better community to exist and be a part of.

P.S. The real heroes in the `ctr` story are my parents whose love is second to none. If you personally want to thank someone, don't thank me, thank them for letting me move back home and supporting me while I chased this dream of mine.
