# Style Evolution

Writing `ctr` in Javascript is a pain in the ass. There are no if's, and's, or but's about it. The whole reason I crafted `ctr` around Stylus was to avoid the monotony of wrapping every Object property and value in a String. Not to mention, the readability of Javascript CSS styles is piss-poor without the aid of visual cues of syntax highlighting. But let's turn that Javascript frown upside down and talk about [YAML](http://yaml.org/) because it ain't a markup language it is the bomb diggity. The best way to convey what I mean, and why you might want to use YAML is through a demonstration of the style evolution.

__Stylus__ <span data-nbsp="11"></span> <span class="arr-i"></span> __The Gold Standard__

__Notes__

+ From the brackets and omission of commas to syntax highlighting Stylus is nothing short of sexy

<div class="cf" data-space="50"></div>

__Javascript__ <span data-nbsp="11"></span> <span class="arr-i"></span> __The Dilemma__

{!javascript/general/_code/style-evolution-js.code.md!}

__Notes__

+ What's the big fuss about? Cognitive fatigue â€” it's the small things in life or so phycology suggests

<div class="cf" data-space="50"></div>

__YAML__ <span data-nbsp="11"></span> <span class="arr-i"></span> __The Relief Pitcher__

{!javascript/general/_code/style-evolution-yaml.code.md!}

__Notes__

+ YAML, the likely or unlikely champion?

<div class="cf"></div>
<div class="end-last"></div>
