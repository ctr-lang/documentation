# Usage

__Webpack__: The majority will feel right at home with the [`ctr-loader`](../javascript/ctr-loader.md){: .pjax}. It simply plugs into Webpack as a `loader` to do the heavy lifting for you. It also allows you to chain `ctr` with other loaders such as [postcss-loader](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-loader) to utilize [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules), and/or [ExtractTextPlugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin) with webpack ease.

__Node__: If you have custom needs or Webpack does not fit the bill the `ctr` Javascript API should offer all the tools necessary to do whatever you please.
