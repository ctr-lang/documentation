The Javascript API is a handful of practical methods to make using `ctr` in Javascript a breeze in the park. In the grand scheme of utility, without adequate CSS or `ctr` knowledge this API will be of no value. In addition, if Stylus is your target language, there is no need to go over this material. I recommend going through the rest of documentation before learning this complementary API.

I initially did not plan on creating this API for the initial release. But, one thing led to another, and over the course of a weekend, Javascript and YAML came crashing into the `ctr` universe. As the documentation progressed so did the Javascript API and currently I feel tentatively content with the API. That being said, I don't foresee any radical changes in the future, but I can't make any promises. Nonetheless, with the hopeful rewrite there will be a much larger emphasis on incorporating `ctr` into JavaScript from the get-go and not as a weekend afterthought.
