`ctr` in Javascript is the same as `ctr` in Stylus, in that the data flows through the same pipeline. This also means, `ctr` is not a run-time CSS in Javascript library nor will it ever be. Moreover, if the use of a CSS in Javascript design pattern is warranted run-time performance and size is of the utmost importance, and this is not the focus of `ctr`. If you are looking for a CSS in Javascript solution, the [styled components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) library is my only recommendation.
