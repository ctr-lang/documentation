# Info

[YAML](http://yaml.org/) is a human-friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages including `ctr`. The data structure of `ctr` is a composition of Objects, Strings, Numbers, and Arrays which makes it a match made in heaven for YAML. Long story made short, if you are unfamiliar with YAML it is similar to [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON) just with syntaxical freedom plus comments; alternatively, it can be formatted just like JSON.
