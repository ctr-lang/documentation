# Info

One of the most powerful concepts when working with Objects is that of merging two or more Objects together to create a single Object. Consequently, the ability to merge an internal and/or external Object(s) into a `ctr` instance whose parts are the composition of Objects is incredibly powerful. On the other hand, `merge`, is one of the features that can create unnecessary confusion and complexity if you fly too close to the sun, so itâ€™s best to use it sparingly.
