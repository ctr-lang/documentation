# Info

The LostGrid supports masonry plugins like [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/), however, to accommodate this support, the margins need to be reconfigured. Instead of applying `margin-right` to everything, a margin is applied to both sides. The two special `grid` properties to make this magic happen are `masonry-wrap` and `masonry-column`, which are designed to be used in tandem.
