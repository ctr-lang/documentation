# Info

Most grids are sub-par at best, and arguably too many developers rely on them all too often. Nevertheless, the [LostGrid](http://lostgrid.org/) CSS grid stands out in a crowd of many â€” a true work of grid beauty. The grid itself is technical-ish, and it is based on `calc` and `flexbox`, so if support for the browser which must not be named is mission critical, you are out of luck. On the flip side, you can produce some real magic armed with this grid once you learn the ropes.

__Notes__

+ Firstly, big shout out to [Cory Simmons](https://corysimmons.com/), the maestro of CSS grids and the creator of the [LostGrid](http://lostgrid.org/)
+ With the `ctr` rewrite, various grid frameworks will become a simple plug and play operation
    * I'm in the works with Cory to put something real special together; a next level grid, of the likes which have never been seen
+ Need be you could always roll out with a custom grip by using ctr [classes](./../class/general){. pjax}
+ A free video tutorial series was put together by [Scott Tolinski](http://www.scotttolinski.com/) on the LostGrid which you can check out at [Level Up Tutorials](https://leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/postcss-tutorials/lost-a-next-level-grid-system)
    * Note `ctr` syntax is a bit different, but the concept remains the same

<div class="cf"></div>
<div class="end"></div>
