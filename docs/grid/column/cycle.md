# Cycle

__Description__: Every element has `float: left` and `margin-right: <gutter>` applied to it except the `last-child` and the `nth-child` in the column where `nth` is controlled by `cycle`.

__Notes__

+ Default: `fraction` denominator
+ Per Lost's documentation: "The concept of cycle is extremely important to Lost and what sets good Lost developers apart from great Lost developers." ~ [Controlling Cycle](http://lostgrid.org/docs.html#controlling-cycle)
    * In my opinion, `cycle` is not extremely important
