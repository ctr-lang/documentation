# Basic

__Description__: The `transitions` Object groups `transition` instances together in which each child Object is treated as a separate `transition` instance.

__Notes__

+ Using the `transitions` Object is a bit silly for `99%` of use cases
+ In the `transitions` Object, you cannot use any `ctr` reserved keys that are not `transition` related, such as `first-child`, `animation`, etc.
