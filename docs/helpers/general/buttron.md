__Notes__

+ An ode to the past; if it were not for this silly little button idea, none of this would have come to fruition. So it seems fitting it gets its own little place in the documentation
    * Rendition one: [Stylus Material Button Mixin](http://codepen.io/artisin/full/xGbgPW/)
    * Rendition two: [Buttron](https://github.com/artisin/buttron)
    * Rendition three: You're looking at it
+ Would I use this, meh probably not, it is primarily here for sentimental reasons
