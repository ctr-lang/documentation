Helpers are a smorgasbord collection of helpful utilities to help you achieve greatness. While some helpers could constitute a section unto themselves, I thought it was best to group them together for clarity. Put simply, helpers can be used within features but features cannot be used within helpers. Alternatively, it may be helpful to think of helpers in the same vein as [compass](http://compass-style.org/) and [Kouto Swiss](http://kouto-swiss.io/). As of right now, I have only included helpers I regularly use. But, with the rewrite, helpers will become a central facet of `ctr` that will act as a plugin hub for all kinds of helper functions.
