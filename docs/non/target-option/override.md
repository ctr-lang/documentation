# Override

__Description__: The `override` option property overrides the entirety of the selector, including the `<identifier>`, with its value.

{!non/target-option/_code/override.code.md!}
{!non/target-option/_code/override.fixture.md!}

__Notes__

+ Due to the nature of Stylus, this feature only works with a declarative `ctr` instance

<div class="cf"></div>
<div class="end-last"></div>
