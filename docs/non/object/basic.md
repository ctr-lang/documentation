# Basic

__Description__: The `nons` Object groups `non` instances together in which each child Object is treated as a separate `non` instance. If the `key` property is not defined in the `non` instance, its Object key is used as the `<identifier>`.

__Notes__

+ In the `nons` object, you cannot use `ctr` reserved keys that are not `non` related, such as `hover`, `animation`, etc.
