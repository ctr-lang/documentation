# Prelude

First and foremost, I would like to give you a warm welcome to the `ctr` documentation and `ctr` in general. All things considered, `ctr` is my "Hello World" and my first major foray into the world of code. Similarly, I'm currently a one-man technical band playing all kinds of instruments so please bear with me during the initial roll out. Nevertheless, buckle up and enjoy the ride, you're in for a treat. And if you want to join me on this Open Source rollercoaster you can grab a front row seat where I will be snapchatting on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/te.schultz/).
