# Declarative Invocation

The declarative invocation is the recommended invocation method. The syntax is clear and concise, plus it forces conformity to the `ctr` paradigm. However, more importantly, it offers complete control to handle any CSS situation under the sun, and the Stylus API mimics that of the Javascript API.

__Notes__

+ In all the examples I use the declarative invocation
+ The experimental Less plugin uses this syntax, and you can read more about it over at the [Less](./../start-here/less/){. pjax} docs
