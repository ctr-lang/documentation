# Synopsis

I’ve written this synopsis a million times over and every time I feel utterly unsatisfied with the outcome. The simple fact is that `ctr` is hard to define in a handful of paragraphs. It’s not that `ctr` as a construct is fragmented or it’s hard to convey in technical terms. Instead, I believe `ctr` is hard to define because it’s not a single idea but rather a symphony of ideas under a single roof.

CSS is a task of repetition, mind-numbing repetition - an age-old problem with many facets. And as the quest for better design continues so does the complexity and the resulting increase of repetition. A proliferation of CSS frameworks and libraries have been created to manage this complexity thereby reducing repetition. However, this has resulted in fragmented workflows with a side of mishmash tool/mixin soup. While brewing my own mishmash tool/mixin soup, I had the great fortune of stumbling upon a new recipe. A recipe called `ctr` that took me down a rabbit hole of programming for the past two years.

`ctr` is a CSS framework, but it’s not comparable to a CSS framework like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites.html), or similar ilk. However, `ctr` is analogous to a CSS framework in that the primary goal is to expedite CSS development and reduce complexity. On many levels, the best comparison to draw upon is CSS preprocessors like [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/), [Less](http://lesscss.org/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/). Many of the concepts preprocessors present such as variables, nesting, and mixins are concepts `ctr` builds upon and around.

At the most basic level `ctr` is an [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects) Oriented CSS framework built on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) that leverages [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) to provide it with a familiar battle-tested CSS preprocessor environment. The data structure employed by `ctr` is that of a key-value pair Object [tree structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) that mimics the [Document Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model). In other words, `ctr` takes one of the most [loved features](https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/806936438797307904) in CSS preprocessors, nesting, and creates a logical and maintainable framework around the concept through Objects. This idea is reminiscent of [Nicole Sullivan's](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/) [OOCSS architecture](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki) and [Philip Walton's](https://philipwalton.com/about/) [OOCSS proposal](https://philipwalton.com/articles/the-future-of-oocss-a-proposal/). And through full-heartedly embracing “Objects” in both structure and application, `ctr` leverages their inherent properties in a manner that is reusable, flexible, and extensible.

It’s through this Object structure that `ctr` builds upon and incorporates the best of the best tools and concepts from the CSS preprocessor and Stylus community. This means you can hit the ground running and start composing your CSS styles right out of the box without wasting your precious time with setup costs. Furthermore, `ctr` introduces new concepts like [classes](./../class/general.md){: .pjax}, [common](./../component/object.md#common-key){: .pjax} centralized style properties, and instance [variables](./../variable/general.md){: .pjax}. Through the combined application of all the concepts, tools, and features that compose `ctr`, it can easily cut CSS development time in half. But the cherry on top of the cake is that `ctr` can be constructed in Stylus, Less, [Javascript](./../javascript/general.md){: .pjax}, and [YAML](./../javascript/yaml.md){: .pjax}, making it the first full-fledged cross-platform CSS solution.

Granted, it may sound like I’m just throwing buzzwords around to sugar coat `ctr` and wow you, but I don’t know how else to explain it. When all is said and done, `ctr` is unlike any other CSS framework, tool, or library and all I can hope for is that `ctr` transforms the way you CSS like it has done for me.
