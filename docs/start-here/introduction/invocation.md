# Invocation

In Stylus, there are two ways to invoke a `ctr` instance, declaratively or imperatively. Each achieves the same results, although, depending on your use-case or style preference, one may prove to be a bit more advantageous than the other.

<div class="cf"></div>

__Notes__

+ By default `ctr` orderes the output CSS via the combined length of the CSS property and its value although this option can be altered

<div class="end"></div>
