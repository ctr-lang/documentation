# Syntax

The Stylus syntax for `ctr` is best described as a hybrid between Javascript and YAML. If youâ€™re unfamiliar with the basic data structure of an Object, it would be in your best interest to hit pause now and do a bit of learning. Nevertheless, before you go any further, there are two **critically important** syntax rules you must abide by in a Stylus `ctr` instance.

1. __Never__ use semicolons - `;`: Forget about them, do not even think about them, they do nothing but cause sorrow, pain, and errors in the Stylus parser.
2. __Never__ use commas - `,`: In Stylus there is no need to separate Object Literals like you do with Javascript.

The syntax may feel a bit weird at first, especially if you do a fair amount of Object play in Javascript. Even if you despise the syntax at first, I recommend you give Stylus an honest run before you decide to ditch it in favor for the YAML or Javascript implementation.
