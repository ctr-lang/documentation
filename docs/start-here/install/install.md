# Install

Half the battle in web development when adopting a new tool into your workflow is getting the damn thing set up with your current workflow. I've spent far to much time doing the install/setup song and dance in my short career, so I decided I would spend the time for you since it is my song and I want you to [dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4d7Wp9kKjA).

__Stylus `ctr`__: I setup boilerplate examples for [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Brunch](http://brunch.io/), and [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/). Check out the install repository for all the examples plus some configuration documentation: [https://github.com/ctr-lang/install-examples-stylus](https://github.com/ctr-lang/install-examples-stylus).


__Less `ctr`__: I setup boilerplate examples for [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Brunch](http://brunch.io/), and [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/). Check out the install repository for all the examples plus some configuration documentation: [https://github.com/ctr-lang/install-examples-less](https://github.com/ctr-lang/install-examples-less).


__Javascript `ctr`__: Currently, the only JS solution is through [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) via the [ctr-loader](../javascript/ctr-loader.md){: .pjax}, although, rolling out your own solution is made easy through the various API [methods](../javascript/methods.md){: .pjax}.
