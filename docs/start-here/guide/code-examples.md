# Code Examples

I've always found the phrase "a picture is worth a thousand words" to be a bit silly because without context a picture is usually not worth a single damn word let alone a thousand. Contextual foundation gives meaning, a particularly important facet in the world of code, but it's also a facet that most of the time is lacking. Admittedly, I never knew why until it became painfully obvious. Writing the code for `ctr` was easy compared to writing the documentation which can be summed up as a special type of hell. Nevertheless, without context, `ctr` is not worth a damn and for this reason I spent six months in documentation purgatory with the single goal of creating quality context. It's also the reason why every example has an interactive code example in both Stylus and YAML. My hope is that somewhere in between the description, notes, and the interactive code example you will be able to find meaningful context. The following are some helpful tidbits of information about the interactive code examples.

__Helpful Tidbits__

+ To initate the interactive examples, the "Interactive Examples" checkbox must be clicked.
+ The interactive examples are similar to that of [codepen.io](http://codepen.io/) or similar ilk, just specifically tailored for `ctr` with error reporting both on screen and in the console. While both `ctr` and Stylus have been slightly modified to work with the browser, they both are full-fledged, and all features should work.
+ Custom syntax highlighting: Both Stylus and YAML have the same custom syntax highlighting applied.
    * Green: `ctr` instances, classes, or set Functions.
    * Blue: features such as `animation`, `element`, etc.
    * Orange: special features keys like `option`, `key`, etc.
+ To activate an interactive example either click the "Edit" button at the bottom-right corner of the code example or just click inside the code to start editing.
+ Full-screen mode: `f11` to go full-screen and `esc` to close.
+ Keybinding is set to Sublime. Life is too short, so love the one you got.
