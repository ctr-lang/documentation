# Considerations

Here are a few considerations that I believe will prove to be beneficial throughout your `ctr` journey.

1. I know I sound like a broken record, but `ctr` is only as powerful as your knowledge of CSS so please learn CSS before `ctr`. Things will assuredly go wrong at some point and the only way you will be able to figure out why is through the CSS output. In fact, while learning the ropes, you should always have the CSS output on the screen until you reach a comfortable level of knowledge.
2. For most features, you can think of them like islands unto themselves. That is, if you want to use `ctr` solely for creating animation, that's a-ok. There is no need for you to think you have to drink all of the `ctr` kool-aid at once. However, it is also important to keep in mind that while features are largely independent of each other, they do create synergistic relationships with one another.
3. `ctr` is recursive by design. Like an [ouroboros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros), it will continue to eat itself until there is nothing left to eat. Features can be used inside of other features for compounding power. But be careful because `ctr` instances can quickly grow out of control to monolithic proportions.
4. Just because you can do something in `ctr` does not mean you should. All of this is extremely new territory, some of which may be right or wrong, and it would be foolish to blindly trust everything I say.
5. All of the examples are interactive for a reason. Don't let this feature go to waste, especially if you don't have multiple screens.
5. If you're looking for guarantees, wait till version `1.0`.
