# General Sections

Each feature is made up of sub-features. If a sub-feature is ordered alphabetically, disregarding `General` and `Feature`, it means the read order is of little importance. If a sub-feature is __not__ ordered alphabetically, it means the read order is important and it should be read from top to bottom. The same goes for the examples/topics within each sub-feature. For better or worse, I apologize to the alphabetical snobs out there, but I felt this was the best option. The following is a general overview of what each sub-feature entails.

__General__: An overview of the feature. It includes the syntax structure, the basic premise and functionality along with other bits of helpful information.

__Key__: Covers the Object key syntaxes that can be used to create/implement the feature.

__Object__: Details how multiple instances of a feature can be grouped together to share common properties and values.

__Specific Option__: As the name implies, options that are specific to the feature.

__Target Option__: Options that target the selector and are the same across all features.

__Feature__: Demonstrates the use of the feature in other features.

Every example has a `Description` which is a formal-ish explanation of said example. Additionally, some particular examples have `Notes` which can range from general thoughts to helpful tidbits and everything else in-between.
