# Browsers and Accessibility

I designed the documentation specifically for Chrome and I have ensured things work in Firefox. Outside of these two browsers, I can't make any promises regarding rendering or even functionality. I simply do not have the time nor desire to dink around to ensure cross browser compatibility. Moverover, I, unfortunately, don't even know where to start when it comes to accessibility and for this I truly do apologize to all of those adversely affected. In the future, I hope to be able to hire someone to sort out both of these issues, but until then this is the best I got.
