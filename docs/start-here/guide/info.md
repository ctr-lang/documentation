# Info

This page will help guide you on your journey through the land of `ctr`. First let's deal with the elephant in the room, the size of the documentation. There is no doubt about it, on the surface level the documentation might appear monolithic, but don't you fret because, in reality, the documentation is a paper tiger. The majority of features share common methods of application, and many features you will only use a handful of times.

I've said it once, and I will say it again, `ctr` is only as powerful as your CSS knowledge and without understanding underlying CSS concepts `ctr` will do you more harm than good. Seriously, I'm pleading with you to put off learning `ctr` until you have a decent grip on CSS. My definition of a decent understanding of CSS is the ability to create a website without a crutch like Bootstrap or Foundation. More specifically, if you're on the fence, I recommend you check out [internetingishard.com](https://internetingishard.com/) &mdash; a fantastic and free CSS/HTML curriculum. CSS is hard, and while `ctr` removes many of the pain points, it's still CSS.
