# Obtain A Token

You can obtain a token right here, right now, but wait there’s <b class="important-text">more!</b> Since you’re an early adapter, you’ll get `55` days to evaluate `ctr` and your token subscription. If you’re not happy, you can cancel at any time before the `55` day trial period is over and you won’t be charged a penny. If you haven't done so already you can read about the token benefits [above](./../start-here/token.md#token-benefits){: .pjax}, and in a nutshell it's a win-win situation for all.

Note: if you’re having technical troubles shoot an email to <code><a data-email="fhccbeg@pge-ynat.pbz" href="support@ctr-lang.com">support@ctr-lang</a></code>. Also if you're looking for a team license they won't be available till after the rewrite, sorry.
