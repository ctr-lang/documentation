# Token Benefits

The objective is to provide such a high level of value it would be irresponsible for you not to purchase a `ctr` token membership similar to that of Amazon Prime. Although, admittedly, at this early initial release stage token benefits are in their infancy. That being said, Iâ€™ll detail the current lay of the land and the soon to come future benefits.

At front and center, a token membership will fund the `ctr` rewrite along with the continuous development and support thereafter. Additionally, a membership removes the hideous popup abomination alongside the accompanying popup guilt. It also provides the means for auxiliary ecosystem add-ons such as the `ctr` [forum board](https://forums.ctr-lang.com/). Outside of these immediate benefits, over the coming months, I will be creating bite-size videos to go alongside with the documentation. However, unlike [`ctr` academy](./../start-here/ctr-academy.md){: .pjax} these videos will not explore features in-depth but rather cover the quick and dirty essential details along with helpful tips and tricks.

Apart from these ideas, the sky is the limit, although it's largely dependent on the number of memberships. Ideally one of the big ticket items is to commission the development of the "next CSS preprocessor" to better mesh with `ctr` and the current shift in the CSS ecosystem. I've also toyed with the idea of creating a `ctr` class marketplace to facilitate the curation and sharing of various community `ctr` class styles. But then again, these big ticket items are dependent on support and if that support translates into dollar bills.
