# Warning

Everything `ctr` _should_ work in the Less plugin, and I've ensured the Less plugin passes all the same tests both Stylus and YAML pass. But, and here's the big but, this Less plugin is at the bottom of my list. Or put another way, friend L (Less) whose a friend, but not a "bestie" is all like "hey, can you please give me a hand". Simultaneously my "bestie" friend S (Stylus) is like "ey, killer this couch ain't moving itself." Even though friend L asked more politely I'm still going to help friend S first, and I can't make any promises I'll find time in my scheduled to even help friend L. Don't judge me, I'll still bring beer over to friend L's house _after_ the move. On the other hand, the Less plugin operates through Stylus, so there should be no problem. I'm just giving you a heads up like a good friend.
