# Info

It’s said less is more until it’s not, and [Less](http://lesscss.org/) does it right in my book. As such, I spent the time to create a Less `ctr` plugin, and while it’s experimental, it does pass all the tests. Granted it’s not the prettiest implementation, but at this point, it would be silly to spend the time to roll out a Less specific lexer and parser. Especially given that after the rewrite `ctr` will handle most, if not all, of the Less boilerplate code that is currently needed.

The Less plugin operates exactly the same as the Stylus plugin. Although, as I've stated in the below warning since Less is not a priority I've decided to write up the lion share of its documentation and info over at the Less install examples [repository](https://github.com/ctr-lang/install-examples-less).
