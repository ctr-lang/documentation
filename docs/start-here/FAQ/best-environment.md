# Best Enviroment?

You may be wondering what is the best environment to develop `ctr` in. That is Stylus, Less, YAML, or Javascript? My recommendation is Stylus or YAML, but the important part is the input not how you input the input. In goes Objects, out comes CSS. This also means need be you can always change environments with relative ease.

At the same time, hypothetically if `ctr` does take off and garners an overwhelming amount of support. And that support translates into dollar bills I plan on commissioning a new preprocessor. That's right I'm that guy, "an asshat, who wants to create another damn framework."  On the other hand, let me put this into context. Sass was released in 2006 the same year New Horizon was launched. And do you know where New Horizon is? Well, it did a flyby of Pluto (not the planet) on July 14, 2015 (my birthday) and is now headed for "2014 MU69", also the name for the esoteric Ikea screw that your dog ate.

I believe in this day of age we need a better solution that incorporates the current reality. The world of CSS has dramatically changed since 2006, heck, only three short years ago it was a mortal sin to write CSS in JS, and now it's commonplace. But more importantly a new preprocessor would open all kinds of doors. If this is something you are interested in I've detailed some tentative specifics at the bottom of the `ctr` [repository](https://github.com/ctr-lang/ctr).


__What I Want (Shortlist)__

+ Better `ctr` support
+ Better plugin support
+ Better variable logic
+ Better Javascript integration to better handle complex logic
+ CSS specific error reporting — "Yo! you're overwriting a previous CSS style"
+ Accessibility hints/helpers
+ The damn __future__

p.s. There’s a chance `ctr` is a dud and it doesn’t make the initial funding goal and if that’s the case, meh, life sucks and the future will have to wait
