# Sass Support

I have bad news for the majority, there's no Sass support as of right now. I thought about it, and it’s possible, but there's little direction as to how to integrate custom plugins not written in Sass. Plus I have a distaste for Sass due to the syntax — I’m a Stylus fanboy. In the future, there’s a good chance there will be an official Sass `ctr` plugin. However, I’m open to helping anyone that would like to take up the endeavor. “Technically” you should be able to drop in the same `ctr` implementation that I created for Less more or less. You can view the Less implementation [here](https://github.com/ctr-lang/ctr/blob/master/lib/ctr-less.js). 

<div class="cf"></div>
<div class="end-last"></div>
