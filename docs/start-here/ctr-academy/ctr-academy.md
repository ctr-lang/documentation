# `ctr` Academy

With confidence, I can say there’s a good chance if it wasn’t for the video medium of [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) and most notably [Mr. WebTunings](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTG-wda3NqCBdRF8n2I-Ohg) Youtube videos on JavaScript I wouldn't be typing these words today. The importance of videos for many, myself included, lie in their ability to build context knowledge from the ground up. That is, with videos you can follow along step by step. Which is why I  believe it's important to provide complementary video lessons alongside the ctr documentation. Because there’s no way around it — ctr is a high-level abstraction that will be difficult to learn, especially if you’re new to coding or you’re not deeply familiar with CSS and its relationship with HTML. Hence, the reason for ctr Academy.

In general terms, the goal of `ctr` Academy is to deliver an optimized learning track to help you learn `ctr` through the use of video lessons, examples, and coding challenges. However, the first task of business in `ctr` Academy is to deep-dive into the depths of CSS to lay the groundwork to build your `ctr` knowledge upon. Because without the proper CSS foundation, you'll hit a glass ceiling quite quickly, and we don't want that. Moreover, by the time you’re done with `ctr` Academy, I promise there will be no CSS challenge too great for your nimble fingers to conquer. No interface or design to complicated to construct due to your lack of CSS knowledge and ability. So in a nutshell, what differentiates `ctr` Academy from other learning platforms is that `ctr` Academy will focus exclusively on CSS and surrounding concepts like design, interface, and experience. 

With that said, there has to be a substantial interest in `ctr` Academy to move forward. Because, unfortunately, it turns out I’m mere mortal, and I already have a full plate with the rewrite and betterment of `ctr`. Which means I don't have time to spearhead the `ctr` Academy myself and will have to hire talented individuals to aid in developing an educational track to make good on my promise.

To help gauge the level of interest and help shape `ctr` Academy I have put together a little questionnaire below. Although, the only required bit of information needed is your email address at the bottom of the form. And this tells me, that you’re interested in `ctr` Academy and want to be notified about its fate as well as receive a special introductory price. Nonetheless, if you have the time, and want `ctr` Academy to be the best it can be filling out the rest of the questionnaire will help with that. And finally I promise never to spam your inbox or sell your data, plus I will only send you two emails in this regard.
