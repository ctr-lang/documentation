# Basic

__Description__: The `states` Object groups `state` instances together in which each child Object is treated as a separate `state` instance. If the `key` property is not defined in the `state` instance, its Object key is used as the `<identifier>`.

__Notes__

+ In the `states` Object, you cannot use any `ctr` reserved keys that are not `state` related, such as `first-child`, `animation`, etc.
