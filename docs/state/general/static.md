# Static

__Description__: A `static` Object in a `state` creates a pseudo-class condition and a matching negation condition, absent of transition properties, for the enclosed CSS regardless of the `<identifier>`. Additionally, a `static` Object can be defined in an auxiliary state Object to omit the generation of transition properties.

{!state/general/_code/static-A.code.md!}
{!state/general/_code/static-A.fixture.md!}

{!state/general/_code/static-B.code.md!}
{!state/general/_code/static-B.fixture.md!}

__Notes__

+ Auxiliary states: `on`, `non`, `common`, and `static`
+ The CSS folks who reside in tall ivory towers will cringe upon the use of `static`, but we live in a world full of semantic-shantics so if it does the trick, to hell with them

<div class="cf"></div>
<div class="end"></div>
