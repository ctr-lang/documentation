# Target

__Description__: A List value for the `target` `option` property in the `common` Object specifies specific `animation` instances to merge with.

{!animation/object/_code/target.code.md!}
{!animation/object/_code/target.fixture.md!}

__Notes__

+ An instance is defined by its Object key
+ The intended purpose is to aid in debugging
+ If an `animation` instance is not defined in the List, it's not merged with the `common` Object
