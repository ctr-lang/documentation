# Basic

__Description__: The `animations` Object groups `animation` instances together in which each child Object is treated as a separate `animation` instance. If a `name` property is not defined in the `animation` instance, its Object key is used as the `<identifier>`.

__Notes__

+ The `<identifier>` for the `animation-name` property can be defined in an individual `timeline` Object otherwise the `<identifier>` defaults to the object key
