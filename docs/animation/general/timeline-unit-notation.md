# Timeline Unit Notation
<div class="te-verified"></div>

__Description__: A waypoint key for the `timeline` Object can be specified as a percent String value or a Number value which is then converted into a percent.

__Notes__

+ I always recommend using a percent String value to avoid any potential mental slip ups
+ Raw numbers are converted into percent
+ You can mix and match with from-to notation
