# Selector Combinator

__Description__: The `selector` `<combinator>` property can be defined in the `option` Object.

{!component/specific-option/_code/selector-combinator.code.md!}
{!component/specific-option/_code/selector-combinator.fixture.md!}

__Notes__

+ Unfortunately, due to Stylus, if you want to use the comma `<combinator>` such as `div, p` you have to use a declarative instance of `ctr`

<div class="cf"></div>
<div class="end"></div>
