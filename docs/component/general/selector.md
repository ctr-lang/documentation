# Selector

__Description__: The value for the `selector` property sets the selector `<combinator>` for the `<identifier>`.

{!component/general/_code/selector.code.md!}
{!component/general/_code/selector.fixture.md!}

__Notes__

+ The `selector` property can be defined inside or outside the `option` Object
+ Unfortunately, due to Stylus, if you want to use the comma `<combinator>` such as `div, p` you have to use a declarative instance of `ctr`

<div class="cf"></div>
<div class="end"></div>
