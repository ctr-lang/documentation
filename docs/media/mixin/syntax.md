    * You should check out rupture's creator [Jeff Escalante](http://jeffescalante.com/) and his new build tool [spike](https://github.com/static-dev/spike) it deserves __much__ more love â€” A+ work in my book
+ At the end of the day, they make working with and reasoning about media queries a bit easier
+ For the examples, I will use the predefined query helpers since I rarely use mixins with raw values
