# Basic

__Description__: The `medias` Object groups `media` instances together in which each child Object is treated as a separate `media` instance. If a `query` Object or property is not defined in the `media` instance, its Object key is used to create a [`mixin Object`](./../media/mixin-object.md){: .pjax}.

{!media/object/_code/basic.code.md!}
{!media/object/_code/basic.fixture.md!}

__Notes__

+ In the `medias` Object, you cannot use any `ctr` reserved keys that are not `media` related, such as `hover`, `animation`, etc.
