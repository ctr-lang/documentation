# A Word of Caution

As Uncle Ben once said, "with great power comes great responsibility." Unbeknownst to me, Uncle Ben had some serious insight when it came to CSS. But in all seriousness, classes are the one feature in `ctr` that give me pause because they can quickly turn against you. Admittedly, classes are a half-baked idea that I implemented during the latter part of the development, but by that time the core data structure of `ctr` was beyond rewriting. As a consequence, I was not able to implement various controls which I believe are needed to a large extent. For example, classes can extend other classes but I recommend you shy away from doing so as of right now. With the rewrite of `ctr`, classes will be treated as a first-class citizen and not as an afterthought and will include debugging and control features which are currently lacking. That being said, I'm not your Mother and you can do as you please, but if things go awry don't tell me I didn't warn you.
