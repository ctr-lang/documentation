Classes are undoubtedly the most powerful and dynamic concept in `ctr`. In comparative terms, all other features in `ctr` are more or less sugary abstractions over CSS to that of classes. But before you jump off this cliff with me it’s essential to learn why you would want to jump in the first place.

The idea of “classes” is the same, or similar, to that of [extend](https://css-tricks.com/the-extend-concept/) depending on your definition. For many years it’s been an elusive dream for legions in the CSS community. In fact, way back in 2013 before I even knew what CSS was, [Philip Walton](https://philipwalton.com/) wrote an article titled “[The Future of OOCSS: A Proposal](https://philipwalton.com/articles/the-future-of-oocss-a-proposal/)” in which he posed two fundamental questions. What if CSS had Object Oriented functionality built in? Further, what if there was a way to create a rich hierarchy of inherited CSS components that didn’t require listing each class in the HTML every single time? Only recently did I have the pleasure to learn about Philip’s work and I’m happy to report I have an answer to these two questions.
