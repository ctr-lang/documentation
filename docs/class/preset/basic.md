# Basic

__Description__: A String value for the `preset` property applies the defined preset to the specified default local variables.

{!class/preset/_code/basic.code.md!}
{!class/preset/_code/basic.fixture.md!}

__Notes__

+ The same results could be achieved through three diffrent classes, but I think you will agree this is a much more elegant solution

<div class="cf"></div>
<div class="end"></div>
