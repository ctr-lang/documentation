The concept of `extend` very well might be the most difficult concept in `ctr` to grasp. I have struggled to find words that do `extend` justice and have ultimately come to the conclusion that `extend` is the "final boss" of `ctr`. Without an intimate familiarity with both [`variable`](./../class/variable.md){: .pjax} and [`class`](./../class/general.md){: .pjax}, you too will be defeated. Although, put in simple terms, if a variable is defined in a `<class>` it can be altered through an extend `<class>` Object. The difficulty comes in practice and understanding the intricacies of `extend`.
