# Basic

__Description__: The `attributes` Object groups `attribute` instances together in which each child Object is treated as a separate `attribute` instance. If the `key` property is not defined in the `attribute` instance, its Object key is used as the `<identifier>`.

__Notes__

+ In the `attributes` Object, you cannot use any `ctr` reserved keys that are not `attribute` related, such as `hover`, `animation`, etc.
