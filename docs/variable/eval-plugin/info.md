There are cases when local variables require a little extra oomph, such as maths calculations or calc transformations. This is where the `eval` Object plugin comes into play. In a future rendition of `ctr`, once I make a decision about how I would like to handle various external plugins, you will be able to create, use, and mix and match an assortment of plugins like the `eval` Object. Nevertheless, as it stands, this is still an early thought and I have not spent the time to fine tune things yet. But, I figured this little taste would wet your whistle.
