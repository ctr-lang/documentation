# processBy Order

__Description__:  The String value of `'order'` for the global `processBy` option property, processes the `ctr` instance recersivly in "order" through a first come first process basis. That is to say it prcess the `ctr` instance and all it's features in a linear fashion from top to bottom. However, employing the `'order'` `processBy` mode is be analogous to purchasing a gun without having an inkling of how to opperate the it besides that of Hollywood action scenes. On the other hand, the converse also holds true, and the `'order'` mode grants unbridled control.

__Notes__

+ Rule of thumb, don't use the `'order'` mode unless know why and how to use it properly, and even then, I recommend you use it on an individual instance basis
+ At face value value the `'order'` mode may seem more intuitive or even correct compared to that of `'level'`, but it's not, and spent a signifigant amount of time so that you didn't have to dink around with proper "ording"
+ A finial parting comparision; `'order'` is like [SkiFree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkiFree) and if you're not carefull the [yeti will gobble you up](https://youtu.be/YUHk9ngfPac)
