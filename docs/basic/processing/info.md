The key word in [Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) (CSS) is [cascade](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade), and it’s one of the most important, powerful, and confusing concepts to grasp. To summarize, "cascading" allows CSS [declaration blocks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Syntax#CSS_declarations_blocks) to combine and resolve conflicting property values with other declaration blocks and style sheets. A deep dive into cascading is outside the scope of this documentation, but understanding the concept of cascading is of the utmost importance. I can not stress this enough, if you don’t understand CSS cascading, [you’re going to have a bad time](https://youtu.be/Zypvv8ig_7s?t=7s), and I want you to have a good time. From this point on I will assume you’re familiar and versed in the wizardry of cascading.

Let me first start off by telling you that I recommend you not alter the process order of `ctr` unless you have to. I've intentionally configured `ctr` in a way to make it hard, but not impossible to shoot yourself in the foot. Nonetheless, once you change the processing order all bets are off, and it's up to you to navigate the treachery of [Cascade Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Mountain_(ski_area)).

ps. _Cascade Mountain is better defined as a hill, not a mountain, nor does it have any connection to CSS except for the fact that it has cascade in the name, and more importantly, it's where yours truly learned how to ski._
