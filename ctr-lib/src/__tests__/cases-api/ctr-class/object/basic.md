__Description__: Should be able to `setClass` with Object syntax in which, each key is the `class` name.


```
{
  <class>: {
    <class-data>
  }
}
```

__Notes__

+ This is more or less intended for yaml, I'm just testing basic functions
    - Check out the `ctr-class` yaml folder to see what I'm talking about
