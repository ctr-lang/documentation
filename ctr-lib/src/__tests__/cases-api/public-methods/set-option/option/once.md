__Description__: Should be able to implement the options just once through a second option of `{once: true}`. The options will be set for just once set and then they will revet back to whatever they where before.


__Notes__

+ `setOption(<Object>, {reset: false, once: false, ctrrc: true, overwrite: false})`
