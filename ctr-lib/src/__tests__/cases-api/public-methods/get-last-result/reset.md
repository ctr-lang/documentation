__Description__: If the `reset` option is passed it should reset the result set

__Notes__

+ `getLastResult(reset = false, raw = false)`
+ `getLastResult({reset, raw})`
+ The `reset` option in `getLastResult` works a bit diffrant than that of `getRes`. The `reset` removes the set in question from the results not the complete results like `getRes` `reset` does
