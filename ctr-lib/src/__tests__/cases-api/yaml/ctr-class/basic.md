__Description__: Should be able to import yaml a file and add all the yaml Object in as classes if the option of `setClass` is `true`


```
<class-one>:
  <class-data>

<class-two>:
  <class-data>
```

__Notes__

+ The idea behind this is you could just have one or a few large-ish yaml class flies and then just import them at entry and boom, you got class galor
