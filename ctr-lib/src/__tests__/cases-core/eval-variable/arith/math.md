__Description__: The user should be able to do maths through the use of the special `eval` keyword of `arith` which will evaluate the expression through a `eval` expression. The user should also be able to use the `Math.<key>` within the `arith` as well to use things such as `sin`

__Notes__

- Removes all characters, so `10px` becomes `10` the `Math` is the exception
