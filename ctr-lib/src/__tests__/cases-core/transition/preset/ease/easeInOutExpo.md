__Description__: If the user uses the predefined preset `ease` of `easeInOutExpo` or `ease-in-out-expo` the resulting `transition-timing-function` should be `cubic-bezier(1, 0, 0, 1)`

__Notes__

+ You can use this `ease` `preset` in `shorthand` as well
+ Preset from `easings.net` -> http://easings.net/#
