__Description__: Should be able to use the Object syntax for filter to build filters

```styl
filter: {
  <filter:key>: <filter:value>
}
```

__Notes__

+ This syntax is just a bit nicer to work with and look at and shit, cus you know, I know you know, that we both know, what you did last summer
+ YOLO
