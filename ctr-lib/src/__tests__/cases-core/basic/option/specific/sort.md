__Description__: On a per indiviudal ctr instance basis the user should be able to define a sort method for the compiled CSS

__Notes__

- There are four sort options
    + `len` -> smallest length to largest
    + `-len` -> largets length to smallest
    + `abc` -> alphablitcally
    + `-abc` -> reverse aplablitcally
    + `false` -> returns the same source order as its given
- The sort order can also be set globally through `ctrSetOption`
