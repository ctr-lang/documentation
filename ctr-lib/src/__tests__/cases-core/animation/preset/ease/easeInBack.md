__Description__: If the user uses the predefined preset `ease` of `easeInBack` or `ease-in-back` the resulting `animation-timing-function` should be `cubic-bezier(0.6, -0.28, 0.735, 0.045)`

__Notes__

+ You can use this `ease` `preset` in `shorthand` as well
+ Preset from `easings.net` -> http://easings.net/#
