__Description__: If the user uses the predefined preset `ease` of `easeInQuint` or `ease-in-quint` the resulting `animation-timing-function` should be `cubic-bezier(0.755, 0.05, 0.855, 0.06)`

__Notes__

+ You can use this `ease` `preset` in `shorthand` as well
+ Preset from `easings.net` -> http://easings.net/#
