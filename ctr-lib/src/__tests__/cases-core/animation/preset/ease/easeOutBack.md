__Description__: If the user uses the predefined preset `ease` of `easeOutBack` or `ease-out-back` the resulting `animation-timing-function` should be `cubic-bezier(0.175, 0.885, 0.32, 1.275)`

__Notes__

+ You can use this `ease` `preset` in `shorthand` as well
+ Preset from `easings.net` -> http://easings.net/#
