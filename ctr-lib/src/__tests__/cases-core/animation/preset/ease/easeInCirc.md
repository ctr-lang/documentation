__Description__: If the user uses the predefined preset `ease` of `easeInCirc` or `ease-in-circ` the resulting `animation-timing-function` should be `cubic-bezier(0.6, 0.04, 0.98, 0.335)`

__Notes__

+ You can use this `ease` `preset` in `shorthand` as well
+ Preset from `easings.net` -> http://easings.net/#
