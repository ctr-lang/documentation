__Description__: Should be able to use the `steps` `animation-timing-function` within the `option` object via the `ease` property.

__Notes__

+ The syntax is as expected `steps(number_of_steps, direction)`
+ You can also use step within `shorthand` notation as well
+ Depending on preference you can use the `string` notation of the `steps` function
