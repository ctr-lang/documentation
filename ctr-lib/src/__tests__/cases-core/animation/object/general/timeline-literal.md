__Description__: As outlined in `animation/general/timeline-literal` the user should be able to use `literal`'s or `string`'s

__Notes__

+ As noted in `animation/general/timeline-literal` you can potentially shoot yourself in the foot using this notation if you're not careful. That being said I recommend you spend the extra time to define the `animation-name` within the individual `timeline` via the `name` key/val rather than using this timeline `literal` notation. You can take a look at the test to see what Iâ€™m recommending if you're confused
