@depreciate -> on the chopping block, did not include in the docs and I'm just keeping this around for posible latter thoughts during the rewrite

__Description__: If there is an `option` object defined within the `animation` all specified `timeline`'s should inherit said options otherwise they will default to the set default options

__Notes__

+ Users are able to specify `multiple: true` either inside or outside the `option` object
