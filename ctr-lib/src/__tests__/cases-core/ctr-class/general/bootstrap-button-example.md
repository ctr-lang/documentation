__Description__: This example demonstrates how a user can create `CtrClass`'s and then extend those classes within a `ctr` instance. In this example I've created some base bootstrap CSS `CtrClass` classes to create a large primary button through the use of `extend`. Thus allowing you the ability to move away from multiple classes within your `HTML` to a more `CSS` centric design paradigm.
