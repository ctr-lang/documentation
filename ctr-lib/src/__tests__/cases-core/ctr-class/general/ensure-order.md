__Description__: In a nutshell this test, test's that a ctr class produces the same order as a ctr instance, in that classes need to perserve the object order to produce the same results as the instance

__Notes__

+ Yeah, ik this test is fucked, but this was the style that fucked me and thus I felt it was fitting to create the same condidions even if its a shitty test
