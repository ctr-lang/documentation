__Description__: Should be able to use `grid` object within a `state` `on` and `non` object

__Notes__

+ `state` `transition`'s will not be generated since there is no point. In fact, you should never need to do this and if you do you're doing something wrong. Neverless, you may be a lost rebel without a cause.
