__Description__: If there are multiple properties defined within the `on`object the resulting transition properties should include all properties as such: `transition-<...>: <prop 1>, <prop 2>, <prop 3>, <...>;`

__Notes__

- All the transition options can be modified through the `option` object, check out `state/option/specific`
