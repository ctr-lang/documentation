__Description__: If the user uses the `key` key/value pair attribute notation within the `option` object of the `attribute` object and said `key` values is a list of attributes then all defined properties within the `attribute` object will be applied to each respected list `key` value.

__Notes__

- It the attribute brackets are omitted they will be generated for you
- For the tests I'm defining  the `attribute` object within a attribute `component` since attribute selectors target attributes.
